# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to configure [Datadog AWS integration](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/v1/aws-integration/).

# How to use this project
usage: |-

  For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

  For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) (which tests and deploys the example on AWS), see [test](test).

  **Note:** At the moment this module supports a limited set of IAM policies to support Datadog integrations. More can be added as needed.

  ### Structure

  This module follows [Datadog's documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/amazon_web_services/)
  by supporting a `core` integration which is the minimum set of permissions needed for any Datadog integration,
  plus an additional integration per service which contains the additional permissions Datadog has documented
  are required for that service.

  To make things easier, this module also implements an `all` integration which includes all the permissions Datadog
  lists under "All Permissions" as the maximal set of permissions required, so you can just set
  `integrations = ["all"]` and be done.

  ### Installation

  Include this module in your existing terraform code:

  ```hcl
    module "datadog_integration" {
      source = "cloudposse/datadog-integration/aws"
      # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
      # version     = "x.x.x"

      namespace                  = "eg"
      stage                      = "test"
      name                       = "datadog"
      integrations               = ["all"]
    }
  ```

  The DataDog integration will be linked with your configured datadog account via the provider's `api_key`.
