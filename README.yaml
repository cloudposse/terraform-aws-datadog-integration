  Terraform Module for integration DataDog with AWS

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  **Note:** At the moment this module supports a limited set of IAM policies to support Datadog integrations. More can be added as needed.

  ### Structure

  This module follows [Datadog's documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/amazon_web_services/)
  by supporting a `core` integration which is the minimum set of permissions needed for any Datadog integration,
  plus an additional integration per service which contains the additional permissions Datadog has documented
  are required for that service.

  To make things easier, this module also implements an `all` integration which includes all the permissions Datadog
  lists under "All Permissions" as the maximal set of permissions required, so you can just set
  `integrations = ["all"]` and be done.

  **Note:** For legacy reasons, the `RDS` policy is retained to be a stand-alone policy for supporting Datadog's RDS integration.
  It is not a good example to follow. Use [`Lambda`](lambda.tf) as your example for adding more integrations.

  ### Installation

  For security, Datadog uses an [AWS External ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html)
  when assuming the role this module creates. To configure this:
  1. Go to Datadog's [integration control panel](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#integrations/amazon_web_services)
     and begin the integration process by adding an account, at which point Datadog will generate the `AWS External ID`.
  1. Set the Terraform variable `datadog_external_id` to the AWS External ID as a string.
  1. Apply the Terraform plan to create the role, and note the name of the role created.
  1. Enter the name of the created role in Datadog's integration control panel where it says "AWS Role name:".

  Include this module in your existing terraform code:

  ```hcl
  module "datadog_aws_integration" {
    source = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-datadog-aws-integration.git?ref=master"
    namespace                  = "${var.namespace}"
    name                       = "${var.name}"
    stage                      = "${var.stage}"
    datadog_external_id        = "dfae1fe3434..."
    integrations               = ["core", "Lambda", ...]
  }
  ```
